## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Make the LED blind a random color.

Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
import board #importing files
import neopixel
import time
import random 

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1) #creates name(dot) for neopixels
dot.brightness =  .1 #sets neopixel brightness

print("Make it red!")

r = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for r(red)
g = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for g(green)
b = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for b(blue)
rgb = [r,g,b] #sets rgb value for random integers

if (r>200): #if r>200 g+b<80 in order to get more solid colors, less white
    g + b < 80

if (g>200): #same principle except for green
    r + b < 80

if (b>200): #same principle for these two except for blue
    g + r < 80

while True:
    dot.fill((rgb)) #make led randomly assigned rgb color
    time.sleep(.5)
    dot.fill((0,0,0)) 
    time.sleep(0.5)


```

### Wiring
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person.
