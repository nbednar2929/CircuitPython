## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Make the LED blink.

```python
import board #importing files
import neopixel
import time
import random 

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1) #creates name(dot) for neopixels
dot.brightness =  .1 #sets neopixel brightness

print("Make it red!")

r = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for r(red)
g = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for g(green)
b = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for b(blue)
rgb = [r,g,b] #sets rgb value for random integers

if (r>200): #if r>200 g+b<80 in order to get more solid colors, less white
    g + b < 80

if (g>200): #same principle except for green
    r + b < 80

if (b>200): #same principle for these two except for blue
    g + r < 80

while True:
    dot.fill((rgb)) #make led randomly assigned rgb color
    time.sleep(.5)
    dot.fill((0,0,0)) 
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

### Wiring
No wiring is required for this assignement.

### Reflection
Given that this was my first circuitpython assignemnt generally eveything was somewhat difficult given that it was all extremely new to me. I had to make sure I imoported all the files I use in this code. I had to look up the syntax required to get a random RGB value which was fairly easy. I also had to add lines 16-23 to the code beause I kept getting RGB values that made the LED all very dull colors.




## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code
Make a 180 degree servo spin back and forth.

```python
import time #importing files
import board
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin 9.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D9, duty_cycle=2 ** 20, frequency=40)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time forward.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
    for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time backward.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
```

### Evidence
Possibly inaccessible video of my servo spinning.

### Reflection
This assignment was more difficult because I had no clue what any of this code meant at first. But after doing plenty of research and reading people's code I was able to understand what the code is communicating. Otherwise the code itself is quite concise and simple.
