## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Make the LED blink.

```python
import board #importing files
import neopixel
import time
import random 

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1) #creates name(dot) for neopixels
dot.brightness =  .1 #sets neopixel brightness

print("Make it red!")

r = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for r(red)
g = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for g(green)
b = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for b(blue)
rgb = [r,g,b] #sets rgb value for random integers

if (r>200): #if r>200 g+b<80 in order to get more solid colors, less white
    g + b < 80

if (g>200): #same principle except for green
    r + b < 80

if (b>200): #same principle for these two except for blue
    g + r < 80

while True:
    dot.fill((rgb)) #make led randomly assigned rgb color
    time.sleep(.5)
    dot.fill((0,0,0)) 
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

### Wiring
No wiring is required for this assignement.

### Reflection
Given that this was my first circuitpython assignemnt generally eveything was somewhat difficult given that it was all extremely new to me. I had to make sure I imoported all the files I use in this code. I had to look up the syntax required to get a random RGB value which was fairly easy. I also had to add lines 16-23 to the code beause I kept getting RGB values that made the LED all very dull colors.




## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code
Make a 180 degree servo spin back and forth accordingly using two buttons.

```python
import time #importing files
import board
import pwmio
from adafruit_motor import servo
from digitalio import DigitalInOut,Direction,Pull
import simpleio

# create a PWMOut object on Pin 9.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.D7, duty_cycle=2 ** 20, frequency=40)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

btn = DigitalInOut(board.D4) #create button 1
btn2 = DigitalInOut(board.D3) #create button 2
btn.direction = Direction.INPUT #create button 1 direction
btn.pull = Pull.UP #pull up button 1
btn2.direction = Direction.INPUT #create button 2 direction
btn2.pull = Pull.UP #pull up button 2

while True:
    if not btn.value: #button 1 being pressed
        for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time forward.
            my_servo.angle = angle
            time.sleep(0.05)
    if not btn2.value: #button 2 being pressed
        for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time backward.
            my_servo.angle = angle
            time.sleep(0.05)
```

### Reflection
I used some code off the internet to get the servo to start spinning. I was confused with how the range variable wokred but when I hovered over it in VSCode it was really helpful in explaining what it does. For the buttons I just stole the code from the [CircuitPython_LCD](#CircuitPython_LCD) assignment but just made two button variables by just putting a two next "btn: in each line. 

## CircuitPyhton_Distance_Sensor

### Description & Code
Create a rainbow gradient with the LED as your your distance sensor reads closer and farther distances.

```python
import time #import files
import board
import neopixel
import adafruit_hcsr04
from adafruit_hcsr04 import HCSR04
import simpleio

sonar = adafruit_hcsr04.HCSR04(trigger_pin=board.D6, echo_pin=board.D7) #initialize sonar sensor with pins
dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1) #creates name(dot) for neopixels
dot.brightness =  .1 #sets neopixel brightness

while True:
    try:
        cm = sonar.distance #rewrite sonar distance
        print((cm)) #print sensor distance
        if cm>=5 and cm<=15: #if cm is between 5-15 range colors accordingly
            r=simpleio.map_range(cm,5,15,255,0) #red goes down
            g=simpleio.map_range(cm,5,15,0,0) #green is abscent
            b=simpleio.map_range(cm,5,15,0,255) #blue goes up
            print("Between 5 and 15")
            dot.fill((r,g,b)) #fills led with color
        elif cm>15 and cm<25: #if cm is betwwen 15-25 range colors accordingly
            r=simpleio.map_range(cm,15,25,0,0) #red is abscent
            g=simpleio.map_range(cm,15,25,0,255) #green goes up
            b=simpleio.map_range(cm,15,25,255,0) #blue goes down
            print("Between 15 and 25")
            dot.fill((r,g,b))
        else:  #prints not good if distance is between 5-25
            print("Not Good")
            dot.fill((0,0,0))
    except RuntimeError: #prints retrying if there's an error
        print("Retrying!")
    time.sleep(.01)

```

### Evidence
Another possibly inaccessible video, but this time it's of an LED gradient in accordance to a distance servo.

### Reflection
This assignment became much easier when breaking it down into smaller chunks. The main important part before the "while True:" is assigning "sonar" to the pin my distance sensor is connected to. After the "while True:" you just need to logically think about when each color comes in using the "simpleio.map_range". The LED should start off red and slowly go down, there should be no green and the blue should slowly come in. For the second half, there is no red, blue slowly fades out, and green will fade in. This all happens as you start close to your sensor and move out.

## CircuitPython_LCD

### Description & Code
Create two inputs, one a button that causes a counter to change by x and two a second input that detrmines whether or not the counter goes up or down by x.

```python
import board #imoprt all files
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface
import time
from digitalio import DigitalInOut, Direction, Pull
from analogio import AnalogIn
import simpleio

i2c = board.I2C() #get an i2c object 
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16) #initiate LCD screen
ptmr = AnalogIn(board.A1) #identify potentiometer

btn = DigitalInOut(board.D7) #identify button
btn.direction = Direction.INPUT #identify button direction
btn.pull = Pull.UP #pull button up
counter = 0 #initialize counter
delta = 1 #initialize variable that counter changes by
lastBtn = btn.value #creates a second button value variable to call back to

while True:
    print(ptmr.value) #print potentiometer value
    lcd.set_cursor_pos(1,0) #set lcd cursor
    lcd.print(" Presses:") #print presses
    lcd.set_cursor_pos(1,12) #set lcd cursor
    lcd.print(str(counter)) #print counter
    lcd.print(" ") #removes excess integers after going between 9-11
   
    
    if ptmr.value<47000: #if potentiometer reads less than 47,000
        lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,0) #set cursor on lcd
        lcd.print("BTN State: Down  ") #print button state: down
        delta = -1 #set delta to -1
    else:
        lcd.set_cursor_pos(0,0) #set lcd cursor
        lcd.print("BTN State: UP    ") #print button state up
        delta = 1 #set delta to 1
    
    if not btn.value and lastBtn != btn.value: #if button is being pressed and button value is not the same as it was prior
        counter = counter + delta #add delta to counter

    lastBtn = btn.value #restating lastBtn
    time.sleep(0.05)
#problems: counts without button press
#zeros stay on the lcd when counting back from ten

### Reflection
This one extremely difficult for me to understand exactly what my code was doing since I took some of it off the internet. I overcomplicated the code and created multiple if and elif statements that were unecessary. I ended up just needing an if and an else and a final if that would change the counter if the parameteres from the prior if and else were met. I still don't fully understand how the line "lastBtn = btn.value" works given that I define them as equal but then later call that my counter will only change if they aren't eqaul, but the code works and that's all that matters.
