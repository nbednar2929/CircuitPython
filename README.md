## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Make the LED blink.

Code:
```python
import board #importing files
import neopixel
import time
import random 

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1) #creates name(dot) for neopixels
dot.brightness =  .1 #sets neopixel brightness

print("Make it red!")

r = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for r(red)
g = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for g(green)
b = random.randint(0,255) #random integer between 0-225 for b(blue)
rgb = [r,g,b] #sets rgb value for random integers

if (r>200): #if r>200 g+b<80 in order to get more solid colors, less white
    g + b < 80

if (g>200): #same principle except for green
    r + b < 80

if (b>200): #same principle for these two except for blue
    g + r < 80

while True:
    dot.fill((rgb)) #make led randomly assigned rgb color
    time.sleep(.5)
    dot.fill((0,0,0)) 
    time.sleep(0.5)
```
